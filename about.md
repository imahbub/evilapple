## Why does this wiki exists

This is my attempt of organizing a central repository of corporate evils. I have built a simple site to do all the things in with minimal effort, and anyone is welcome to edit the pages and discuss it in the main repo discussion page.

## What are "evil apples"?

Evil apple is a term I have used throughout the wiki to describe companies that have and continued to have malicious intentions towards people and the environment whether directly or indirectly. I have categorised each types of behaviours and the description can be found at the page [/deeds](/deeds)

## Are you an Apple hater?

The name Evil Apple may cause confusion to some audiences. While the company Apple is inherently evil, they are not the only evil company. The site is named around the term "evil apple" which means bad apple. It means that in a basket full of apples, some are very rotten and causes harm to humanity.
